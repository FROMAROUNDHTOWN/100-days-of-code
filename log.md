# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 12, 2016 
##### 
**Today's Progress**: Did research on Git hub to figure out how it actually works. Also intersted in working with SWIFT. I heard it's the beginner's preferred language. 

**Thoughts:** Git hub is not really difficult, but there are a ton of functions and that's not bad at all. Looking forward to day two and actually being able to implement more.
